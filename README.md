# GenAI with TypeScript

A learning project exploring modern AI application development using TypeScript, focusing on state-of-the-art SDKs, frameworks, and architectural patterns.

## Overview

The goal is to create examples needed to build advanced AI applications, including model routing, tool calling, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), vector databases, evaluation frameworks, and agent-based systems.

## Technologies Being Explored

- **[Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction)** – API and streaming tools for building AI apps.
- **[Mastra](https://mastra.ai/)** – Unified orchestration for AI agents and tools.
- **[Assistant UI](https://www.assistant-ui.com/)** – Pre-built UI components for building chat interfaces.
- **[Langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs)** – Graph-based agent orchestration for complex workflows.

## Core Concepts

- **Model Routing**  
  Direct prompts or tasks to the appropriate model based on criteria like task type or expected output.

- **Tool/Function Calling**  
  Enable AI models to call external functions/tools dynamically during interactions.

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Enhance model outputs with external knowledge fetched at runtime, usually from vector databases.

- **Vector Databases**  
  Store and retrieve embeddings to support semantic search and context injection for AI models.

- **Evaluations (Evals)**  
  Techniques for systematically evaluating the performance and outputs of AI systems.

- **Agents**  
  Systems where AI models can make decisions, call tools, plan actions, and reason over multi-step tasks.

## Examples

- **Text Completion**  
  Text completions using AI models.

- **Text Completion (Streaming)**  
  Text completions using AI models with streaming responses.

- **Image Analysis**  
  Attach images to get textual descriptions and analyses.

- **Invoice Data Extraction**  
  Generate structured data from PDF files using AI models.

- **Invoice Data Extraction (Streaming)**  
  Generate structured data from PDF using AI models with streaming response.

- **AI Chat Assistant**  
  Interactive chat interface with streaming AI responses, perfect for building conversational AI applications.

- **Weather Assistant**  
  Get real-time weather information using Tool Calls.

- **Commit Message Generator**  
  Convert natural language descriptions into conventional commit messages.
